# OOP Course Repository
Welcome to my repository of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course I took in University. 
This is where you'll find all the materials for labs, a mini project, and a final project.

## Structure
- **Labs**: Three hands-on assignments reinforcing OOP principles.
- **Mini Project**: An individual assignment applying OOP concepts to a small-scale project.
- **Project**: The course's main project, done in groups, demonstrating mastery of OOP in a real-world scenario.
  
## Getting Started
- Clone the repository.
- Each directory has a README.md with instructions.
